# Contributing

All contributions/Feedbacks are more than welcome!

## How can I contribute?

If you have an awesome new feature that you want to implement or you found a bug that you would like to fix, here are some instructions to guide you through the process:

- **Create an issue** to explain and discuss the details
- **Fork the repo**
- **Clone the repo** and set it up (checkout [README.md](https://github.com/itsdheerajbudhiraja/express-boilerplate-ts/blob/main/README.md))
- **Implement** the necessary changes
- **Create tests** to keep the code coverage high
- **Ensure Build and Lint** before sending PR using commands: `npm run build` and `npm run lint-fix` to ensure code is compiling and consistent format is followed.
- **Send a pull request**

## Guidelines

### Git commit messages

- Husky pre commit hook is there to help selecting proper commit type and other information as required
- Limit the subject line to 90 characters
- Capitalize the first letter of the subject line
- Use the present tense ("Adds feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
- Reference issues and pull requests in the body

### Coding style guide

We are using ESLint to ensure a consistent code style in the project.

Some other ESLint plugins are also being used, such as the [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) and [Jest](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest) plugins.

Please make sure that the code you are pushing conforms to the style guides mentioned above.
